Hi there! My name is Bryan Hew i was a part of the MindLabTranslators Project team and i had the pleasure to work alongside some fellow classmates on this application.

The idea of this application came about just after the COVID Crisis and wanted to help design soemthing that could aleviate their workload. 

This would be done in the form of a smart phone application by connecting a carergiver to their patients using our mobile application and using mobile phone sensors report potential falls or issues. By using this system, the elderly patients could live from home rather than in a retirement villiage or any type of hospital care center. If the phone gyros indicate that a fall has taken place measured by the phones relative position and rapid acceleration, it will prompt the elderly patient that they can call for assistance and even call emergency services if need be. If no response is given within a short time frame then emergency services and care givers will be notified.

The core functionality of the applciation seems to be working in a virtual environment, if given more time we would begin real mobile application testing and touchups with the visual elements to make it more user friendly.

I worked on this project for about a year alongside my studies before we lost support and the project unfortunately was sunsetted and the team disbanded

So unfortunately i cannot create another repository and display all files here as its currently linked to BitBucket however will be adding in photos and stuff to show what it looked like
